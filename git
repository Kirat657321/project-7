    <p> The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. 
        It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the
         domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. Valued by humans for companionship and its ability
          to kill vermin, it is commonly kept as a pet and working cat, but it also ranges freely as a feral cat, avoiding human 
          contact. Its retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey species such as mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible
           body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense
         of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator.</p>
